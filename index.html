        <h2>About Emerge</h2>
        <p>Emerge is a celebration event. We celebrate the amazing work of our learners, the fantastic input, guidance,
            and mentorship of the supervisors from both our industry partners and our own teaching teams, and the
            support they receive from whānau and friends.</p>
        <p>
            It’s also a culmination of a great deal of hard work by the learners in their final stages of their study
            here at Ara in preparation for their future careers in technology. It’s a chance for them to fully apply all
            the learning that has taken place throughout their study to real-world IT problems in a work setting.
            They need to use their skills, knowledge, experiences, and ability to work with others to succeed. This
            experience culminates in them presenting their work to a panel of industry and academic supervisors and also
            in producing the posters that you will see tonight at this event.
        </p>
        <p>
            Emerge is also the starting point for the next phase of life for our learners and their IT careers, and we
            couldn’t be prouder. Please join us in wishing them all the best for the future, speak with them and learn
            about not just what they’ve done, but what they can do in the future.
